# What's gone wrong the Venus project

## Structure

### Board of directors
Venus Project (will be mentioned as VP) has a set of people, who has a vote in making decisions called board of directors.
During the date of writing it consists of Roxanne Meadows, Borislav Zlatanov, Nathanael Dinwiddie, Theofilos Chaldezos. 

For public, it is not clear why all these people are main in the VP and what have they done.
Every director should have tasks he would be doing and make a public overview of his job.
It is clear if the director is not effective on his position or he is not qualified enough for his job, he should be replaced.
+ What are requirements for each of them?
+ Are this people effective? 
+ What do they do every day? 
+ Is their work even needed?


### Processes
From creating of VP it was very close, people who donate there and public all over the world doesn't know what are VP doing.
For example finance movement, organisation plans, what plans are achieved, what are next results.
It should be changed, how closed organisation which does not share information about their results and plans could change the whole world?
What are results of your work for the last 5 years?
Why VP put pressure on the movement? 

### Finance model
Finance modal of VP is obsolete. VP publicly is telling us that every man over the world should be educated, knowledge should be free, world without money, but what they actually do? 
They sell materials for money. I am not telling about actual books which are made from paper, it's totally okay, because they are requiring money to be produced. But every digital material should be free. 
It is clear that organisation should have money to function, but there are a lot of types of monetize materials without forcing to pay.
For example free pay model, where material is free, but everyone can donate, advertisement on youtube, etc.

## Evolution

Board of directors made a change in VP program called "evolution". They still haven't made clear all the questions but some questions to them can be asked due to public materials they made.

### Partners and advisors

VP ruined whole reputation via selecting very lousy partners.


Yevhen Sliuzko in [Death of the Venus Project](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BXq9oXBC9e8eQsbLxdh0T0FdiJEzN1phX3c9Og0baU) made a good job, researching the Simon [who is a principal advisor](https://www.thevenusproject.com/about/advisors/) of VP.


Thorium network is very doubtful partner, firstly he will make money selling cryptotokens, which can be a big scam project, secondary they have workers that work as ["spiritual healing"](https://web.archive.org/web/20211230145253/http://dusyasmiraclehealing.com/), and saying that [vote for Putin is a vote for humanity](https://t.me/thethoriumnetwork/9026).


### Jack is obsolete?
VP describes an [evolution cause as a change in environment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBSDmuRFyNg&ab_channel=MoneylessSociety). Decisions are made on Simon works which has a lot of critic in science world, and was not protected or even reviewed by specialist is this field.
VP comes to apocalypse-like system where world energy is very limited and humanity may not live as it used to.
But even Jack was telling about geothermal energy and other types. VP said that they made a big research of fields where they can adopt VP, can they share results of research? Can they made a critics of their own? Maybe they should involve science community in reserching of Simon's work and restructure a program if Simon is wrong.
Also VP now oriented in the [end of the world scenarios](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-BXq9oXBC9e8eQsbLxdh0T0FdiJEzN1phX3c9Og0baU).

# Summary

It is totally clear that VP faced bad times. Project team was passive in the past, and now the worst thing they can do is to make a project reputation worse, and make a wrong decisions.
Lack of results made clear requirement of changes, but change direction is wrong.
